    File: ctf_client.lua
    Description:
        This is the main client file and its main purpose is:
            - To handle the following client related logic executed via our main thread: (see CreateThread).
                - To perform team selection and camera manipulation if the user is in camera selection: (see boolean bInTeamSelection).
            
            - To handle certain client-side flag logic:
                - processFlagLogic: Used to update the state of a flag from the client, i.e.
                    - If the client dies (their health is below 1) the flagStatus is set to EFlagStatuses.CARRIER_DIED.
                        - The server then takes note of this and updates everyone telling them the flag was dropped.

            - To receive team data from the server via events: (see receiveTeamData).
    
    Event handlers:
        - playerSpawned: Dispatched by FiveM resource spawnManager when the player spawns (https://docs.fivem.net/docs/resources/spawnmanager/events/playerSpawned/)
            We use this event to set the player's position to the base position on first spawn (or respawn after death).

    Variables used by this script:
        - bInTeamSelection: Stores whether the user is in camera selection or not, set by method: setIntoTeamSelection.
        - bShouldShowTeamScreen: Boolean that stores whether the team screen used to pick a team should be shown. 
            It is set to true on script initialization and false once a team is picked.

        - receivedServerTeams: A table assigned by receiveTeamData, holding data sent from the server.
            It contains information about the teams the user may pick (Red and Blue).

        - lastTeamSelKeyPress: Used to introduce a cooldown period 'on left/right click' when cycling through team selection.
            Without this cooldown, rapid clicks could lead to unintended and fast team cycling.

        - localTeamSelection: Stores the local team, mainly used to decide if the client should go into team/camera selection.
            It is also used to spawn the client at their respective base (see 'playerSpawned' event).
            
        - activeCameraHandle: Stores the created camera handle (set by CreateCam in setIntoTeamSelection) for later use.
